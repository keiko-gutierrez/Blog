          <Text> When I worked in hospital security I caught a casual contract security officer accessing the cameras he
            wasnt supposed to touch and spying on various people including myself.
            I asked what he was doing and he told me to mind my own business. I knew what he was doing was a crime so
            I told he he can apologise and turn himself into the manager or I will be following up with his boss. He
            was a contractor meaning he worked for a company that provided us with extra staff when needed.

            He refused kept saying he is allowed to play with cameras and claimed dbecause he had been working there
            as a contractor longer than I had been employed he out ranks me. I ignored him and reset the cameras to their
            correct positions, then took the keyboard and mouse off him.
            Once back at my station I  wrote an email to his boss and ccd my boss into it.
            When the shift change was due the day manager checked in on me, I explaineed the situation and she
            immediately sent him home and told him he will not be getting any more work on our site.

            Due to his behaviour, he was let go from his company and as such lost his visa status resulting in
            being sent back to his home country.
            This decision was incredibly easy and I have no issues around how things worked out for him. </Text>

          <Heading> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</Heading>
          <Text>I always knew I was different growing up but never really understood why.
                My family was not your typical kiwi family. I have a lot of cousins as my grandparents had 9 kids.
                and each of my cousins were mixed with another ethnicity. our Grandparents were Rromani but that was
                kept from us.
                See my ancestors had fled to New Zealand to escape the racism and hatren of the Roma that is still
                happening throughout Europe. The european authorities harassed us, made a slaves, stole our children
                had apathied laws preventing
                us from associating or becomming citizens in the countriesd we had lived in for generations. This is
                still happening.
                So many decided to leave when they heard about the new world. The thing is that realistically we are
                white presenting enough we can pass for white people, so that what my family did, hid out of some
                ships and came to NZ.
                I am 6th generation now. My family ties into the colonial history of New Zealand but not the way
                most paheka do. My family when meeting the local indigenous realised pretty quickly that the british
                troops will be persecuting Maori
                much like the way we were, and so tried to build relations with the locals. I have stories of my
                family slipping past british lines to deliver goods to local tribes doing what they can while trying
                to draw attention to themselves.
                But because of this, it meant my family had to give up a lot of our culture.
                We lost our languages and many traditions. and while I am thankful I was able to grow up in a
                country like NZ it comes with the knowledge that i will never experience the richness of my ethnic
                people.

                I guess because of this, I find racism easy to identify, I understand intergenerational trauma. I
                consider myself an ally to indigenous and bipoc all over the world, and identify as bipoc myself.
                I want to reclaim as much of my cultures as I can. I have been research not just my Rromani heritage
                but also that of my nordic, scottish and sepphadic jewish history as well.
                I threw away my christian beliefs that i was brainwashed with as a child and have been learning to
                reconnect with the religions of my ancestors.
                I use the knowledge I gain to help ally anbd fight for others so people dont have to grow up cut off
                from who they are and have a very just personality.
                I try to hold other to account, and push for equality for all marginalised groups.

                I also belong to a few other socio culture groups outside of ethnicity. I am disabled with multiple
                health conditions and am neurodiverse. Im part of the rainbow mafia as well identifying as poly,pan,
                ace+, trans, agender.
                All of these differences and growing up marginalised has made me very aware of society and the
                issues society as a whole is facing today.

                The bigest adjustment I had made in my life was accepting my neurodiversities. Being autistic
                espoecially as my entire life i believe their was soimething wrong about me, when in reality i just
                spent a lot of time trying to fit in with neurotypical social constructs. Now that I know i am
                autistic and have begun socialising with the autistic community, I have found a place where i fit in
                and share similar
                values and ethics. I am rediscovering who I am. One way to to explain this would be to describe
                Neurotypicals having a windows operating system, and as kids everyone gets the windows operating
                guide.
                but Austistics are more like linux. and some autistics who got diagnosed in childhood get given
                their own linux operating manual, those of us us who got missed, end up with a windows manual for a
                linux system.
                so we are trying to conform to the windows manual, we learn to mask, like creating an interface that
                mimics windows. and it kind of works, but at the core its different. Finally being diagnosed
                autistic means i now have the correct manual but i have go back and unlearn the windows, remove the
                windows interface i built and start learning this linux manual.

                this can create difficulties for me within in both groups. Nueortypicals Operating on windows still
                dont understand me as I am linux, but in the same way it can be hard to connect with autistics who
                grew up
                autistic since, they know their linux manual and dont realise that for us late diagnosed, we are
                only just learning it now and get confused between this new way and the old windows manual we kept
                trying to make work. </Text>

          <Heading>  Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations. </Heading>
          <Text>I guess because of my history I have become a very strong advocate for others and
            constantly pushing to decolonise the world and make it a fairer more equitable place for everyone. I
            have good leadership skill, really good a organising and planning,
            but I also thrive in chaos. I need order but my own order which to other can look very chaotic. I love
            to listen to others stories and always look for ways to improve my life and the lives of those around
            me. I am often first to offert a hand
            to others who need assistance but find it really hard to ask for help for myself.

            I guess my main limitations i find is dealing with neurotyipical communication styles as lateral
            thinking leaves me very confused. I commonly miss social cues and find the subtext that exists within
            neurotypical communication baffling.
            I am very honest and straightfoward. I dont say things I dont mean and dont like when people lie or say
            half truths. I like people who are direct and tell me straight however I have found that most
            Neurtypical people lack the ability to do so,
            this leads to a lot of confusion as the nuerotypical person thinks they were very clear, however they
            were not being direct so i didnt understand at all what they were trying to tell me.

            If you would like to understand more about these communication issues follow this link. </Text>

          <Text>I am in the top 1% of the top 1% for pattern recognition, as such i seem to find learning the technical
            aspects of development fairly easy. The obsticles is
            in answering questions like this one. I struggle with any lateral thinking, evverything must follow a
            logical direct pattern. This can cause me to experience difficulties in dealing with other people,
            especially when i am unable to understand any indirect communication styles.
